    <h1>The Power Love has Over Fear in Romantics Anonymous </h1>
    <h3>A Visual and Thematic Analysis</h3>
    <p>This film portrays two people, Angelique and Jean, who struggle with
    relationships, but find each other through a cake shop that they both work
    at. Although their relationship starts as strictly professional, an atmosphere
    of tension slowly builds between them. As the film goes on, the two face 
    their feelings and their love comes to life, resulting in a relationship either
    of them thought was possible</p>

        <h2>The Significance of the Title</h2>
        <h5>“Romantics Anonymous” is a spin off of the term Alcoholics Anonymous, 
            which is an addiction support organization that focuses on helping 
            those who abuse alcohol</h5>

            <h3>This is why it's a significant choice:</h3>

            <p>The story begins with, and repeatedly returns to Angelique's 
                support meeting in which she gives the narrative of the
            plot, including her romantic interests, tying in both aspects 
            of the title</p>

            <p>Jean ends up attending one of her meetings, which leads 
                to the arch of their relationship as they are able to open up
            about each other given the support of the other attendants.</p>

        <h2>Mise-en-Scene - Casual Lighting</h2>

        <h5>Lighting is a very prominent element of mise-en-scene in this film:</h5>

        <p>The lighting in scenes like the kitchen (5:00 and 27:39 as examples), 
            along with scenes outside (12:00 being one) tends
        to be brighter, and very high-key</p>

        <p>
            These brighter lighting schemes give a more casual and less tense 
            feel to these scenes featuring everyday situations
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide" id="slide3">
        <h2>Mise-en-Scene - Deeper Lighting</h2>

        <h5>There are moments where the lighting is dimmer, and coming 
            from sources of lower power on the screen such as lamps</h5>

            <p>Such lighting is seen in the restaurant (16:22) and hotel room scene (55:18)</p>

            <p>This is a very significant juxtaposition to the more casual lighting 
                since it appears more when Angelique and Jean are
            alone together and gives strength to the growing romance between them</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide" id="slide4">
        <h2>The Beginning of Jean's Character Development</h2>

        <h5>Jean is the main driver of the plot</h5>

        <p>He is very shy and anxious when it comes to romance, 
            finding it difficult to open up to women</p>

        <p>In the first scene with his therapist, even 
            just talking about the topic to someone he 
            trusts has him very tense</p>

        <p>He is changing facial expressions rapidly, avoiding eye 
            contact at times, and breathing a little heavily, including in
            this medium close up from behind his therapists shoulder</p>
        
        <h5>Then the scene concludes with the therapist telling Jean 
            to ask someone to dinner as an exercise</h5>
        
        <p>There is a long shot showing both of them during this segment</p>

        <p>Including them both in the frame makes them feel confined and as 
            though Jean can't escape the therapists request: he's
        committed to this character development</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide" id="slide5">
        <h2>Fighting through the Question - The First Step</h2>

        <p>Following the scene with the therapist, we are shown a 
        scene with Angelique talking to the other employees as they 
        try to make her a sales rep.</p>

        <p>The next scene opens with a pov shot of Angelique watching 
            Jean and an employee talking about the sales rep position</p>

        <p>She wants to clear this up so she can be baker so she walks 
            up to Jean, with the camera dollying in behind her, and as
        she gets close, we see Jean getting closer to her as well</p>

        <p>Right as she is about to talk to him about her position, he 
            abruptly tells her he's taking her out to dinner, just as he
        set out to… he's taking the first step, the power of love is taking over</p>

        <p>Not only is this an important moment, but having the mix up with 
            Angelique's position between the therapist scene and this moment, 
            was a great way to distract the audience from Jean and make it 
            all the more shocking when he asks Angelique out. By making this 
            more surprising, we believe that much more in Jean's willpower to 
            overcome his fear</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide" id="slide6">
        <h2>A Very Revealing Reaction by Angelique</h2>

        <p>Not only does Angelique agree to go out with Jean, but as she's 
            walking away, the camera dollies back out of the kitchen
        with her, facing her and showing an out-of-focus Jean in the back.</p>

        <p>We also get a first person narration of Angelique's feelings 
            during this moment as she walks off, which reveals that she
        has been waiting for this and is excited to experience it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide" id="slide7">
        <h2>Love Overcoming Fear in Jean's Physical Touch</h2>

        <p>Jeans next assignment is to escalate to touching someone, 
            which occurs at 27:39 with Jean awkwardly walking in the
        kitchen trying to touch his employees</p>

        <p>Some medium and close up shots display the employees discomfort, building tension</p>

        <p>A wide shot, containing deep space composition, shows Jean in 
            the spotlight centered in the kitchen, getting stared down
        by his employees.</p>

        <p>Eventually he chases Angelique down when she runs out after a 
            dispute, and after another tense moment, we get a pov shot
        of Jean finding Angelique's hand, and in a medium shot, the two 
        are both shown in frame, holding hands.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="slide" id="slide8">
        <h2>The Significance of Jean's Physical Touch</h2>

        <h5>This scene, and shot in particular, are very important for a couple reasons:</h5>
        
        <p>Jean tried to touch other employees, but clearly failed, 
            and only succeeded when he attempted it with Angelique,
        signifying a connection between the two</p>

        <p>Most of the interaction cuts back and forth between them, 
            but when they hold hands, they are both in frame, which can
        represent them coming together, and even allude to the way 
        a husband and wife stand at their wedding, which is
        foreshadowing</p>

        <p>Their first couple of close interactions happened indoors, 
            the dinner proposal and the restaurant, but this one occurred
        outside. Changing from indoors to outdoors like this can 
        symbolize Jean getting outside of his comfort zone and
        overcoming his fears, because of the power that his love 
        for Angelique has over his fear</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide" id="slide9">

        <h2>Fear and Love Meet</h2>

        <p>At the end of the film 1:05:47, Jean chases 
            Angelique down again when she runs away to her 
            support meeting. He finds her at the meeting, 
            which makes the meeting a recurring image.</p>

        <p>The group gives Jean a chance to talk, and he 
            discusses how he loves a woman and wants to be 
            with her in a real relationship. He's clearly 
            talking about Angelique.</p>

        <p>Once he gets deeper into his feelings for her, the 
            camera starts cutting between the two, and through 
            a series of these shots, we are shown Jean directing 
            his words at Angelique, and she realizes he's talking 
            about her. His love for her finally allows him to 
            open up about his feelings</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide" id="slide10">
        <h2>Against the Odds</h2>

        <p>Despite Jean's confession, the relationship almost 
            doesn't happen because Angelique responds 
            with a monologue about why the relationship 
            wouldn't work and drives Jean out of the room</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide" id="slide11">
        <h2>Love wins</h2>
        <p>Even though Angelique tried to explain to Jean why 
            they wouldn't work as a couple, a man in the group 
            stands up and tries to convince her that the two are 
            really meant for each other and that she needs to 
            rethink her rejection. The camera sits right behind 
            Angelique and looks up at the man standing, a shot 
            which portrays that this man talking is taking control 
            of the situation and trying to obtain power so Angelique 
            listens.</p>

        <p>The scene cuts to Angelique running out of the meeting 
            after Jean to let him know that she accepts him as a 
            romantic partner and that she wants a relationship. 
            They make it official with another kiss in a scene, again, 
            filmed with some deep space composition displaying the 
            members of the group and kitchen employees in the background. 
            This composition essentially symbolizes how the two worlds 
            have come together with the couple, that these worlds revolve 
            around, in the middle</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide" id="slide12">
        <h2>Fear Overcome by Love - The Wedding</h2>

        <p>The film ends with Jean and Angelique's relationship 
            reaching the highest level of getting married, or at 
            least it's supposed to end that way. But Jean and 
            Angelique sneak out and run off.</p>

            <p>A long shot follows them as they run away from the 
                wedding with the church in the background. The escape 
                symbolizes that they are happy with where they are, maybe 
                even because they didn't expect to get this far, therefore 
                they don't need anything else like a celebration, just 
                each other</p>

        <p>One could also argue the image of them running off in the 
            last shot can symbolize their (specifically Jean's) fear
            finally leaving them, or them escaping their fear, now 
            that Jean has officially overcome his fear because of the 
            power of his love for Angelique</p>

    <div class="slide" id="slide13">
        <h2>In Conclusion…</h2>

        <p>This relatively short but very well made romance 
            film not only portrays a classic, fairytale style 
            narrative of two people, with little success with 
            relationships, falling in love, but it teaches a 
            valuable lesson about leaving the comfort zone and 
            overcoming fear so we can achieve our greatest and 
            most daunting goals.</p>

            <p>Through some interesting cinematography, editing, 
                and acting, this film follows Jean, a chocolate manufacturer, 
                as he perseus his love for Angelique and finally breaks 
            through what has been holding him back this whole time, 
            which is fear, because his love for her was more powerful.</p>
