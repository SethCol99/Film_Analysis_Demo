        <h2>Significant Cinematic Elements Used</h2>
        <p>Hitchcock's film Rear Window features heavy use of editing to connect Jeff's highly confined apartment life, intimately,
        to the rest of the world. One of the most common techniques is the many point of view shots of smaller moments such as
        Doyle looking at Lisa's night bag and Jeff watching the light under the door disappear as Lars arrives. More significant
        instances include the multitude of occurrences when a medium shot of Jeff looking right passed the camera is juxtaposed
        with a shot of the particular neighbor he is looking at. The corresponding shots of his neighbors are either long, or
        also close ups if h's looking through binoculars or his camera. This very repetitive point of view editing is used to
        bring focus and emphasis to his observations despite them being relatively far away.</p>
        
        <p>The film also seeks to maintain continuity and logic when the shots normally used would cause disorientation. An example 
        of this is when Jeff is sleeping and can't look through his window at what is happening. The classic point of view shot we 
        would normally see would't make sense in this case since Jeff is sleeping and we can't logically tie his sight to anything 
        outside. However, the camera is used as a narrator when it pans over showing the outside where Jeff would normally look, 
        which continues the narration of what's outside.</p>
        
        <p>The film has various paces as well, with slower pacing in more dialogue based
        scenes like when Jeff is describing his job experiences to Lisa. We then see quicker pacing in the fight scene at the
        end between Jeff and Lars to convey excitement and chaos. This scene is also edited in parallel with shots of the
        neighbors and police rushing to the fight, bringing a relationship to the two actions and building suspense as the
        opposite forces come together. The film also has narrative parallels to Notorious in the way that a man is leading the
        mission/story and is joined by a female who normally wouldn't be in the picture. Whether the man wants the woman there
        or not is questionable, but there is a romantic element to the narrative and at the end of the day, the two must work
        together.

        <h2>An Important Scene - Jeff Uncovers Lars' Truth</h2>

        <img src="pics/rear_window_caught.jpg" 
        alt="Lars getting caught by the police as he catches Lisa in his appartment">
        <h5>http://throughthereels.blogspot.com/2015/09/afi-top-100-48-rear-window.html</h5>

        <p>The scene begins with Lisa, Stella, and Jeff investigating the 
            flowers right after the dig is found dead. The scene begins with a medium
            two shot behind Lisa, Stella and Jeff, showing them all looking out 
            the window and serves as an establishing shot.</p>
            
            <p>The scene is shown in low key lighting with the room being mostly 
            dark, but the apartments across from them are better lit. This contrast 
            conveys, rather literally, that the rest of the apartments are in their 
            normal, everyday existence, and the three are hiding in the shadows, 
            secretly watching over them. It can also mean that they know the darkness
            that's contained on that side of the courtyard, but they're bringing 
            into the light, like they're “shedding light” on the situation with this 
            new discovery about the dog.</p>
            
            <p>we then get brought to the front of them, in a medium shot to the right 
            which we see them looking across, and Jeff is looking through his camera 
            lens, which sets up a pov shot that follows when the camera does a cut to 
            Lars wiping his wall down</p>
            
            
            <p>Again, there is a very strong contrast between the darkness on the outside 
            of the apartment and the inside where Lars is. The window is also very small 
            and there is little view into his room compared to the other apartments. Such 
            a spacial contrast may be symbolic for how everyone else (having much larger 
            access to outside) is more free and Lars is seen as more confined, like he's 
            being closed in on and trapped, almost like his room is a prison - which he's 
            on his way to.</p>
            
            <p>We are brought back to the three in Jeff's apartment looking out in the same 
            mid shot style as before, then the camera cuts to a close up of Lisa and Stella, 
            isolating them from Jeff. The isolation is not just because they'e having a
            conversation about Stella's theory of Lars wiping blood off the wall, but also 
            by juxtaposing this shot with an isolating shot of Jeff, which we see right after, 
            a more significant point of view shot is set up when Jeff leans up and looks as 
            though he sees something strange outside.</p>
            
            <p>The pov shows a shot of the flowers that the dog dug through, and this sparks a 
            frenzy in Jeff as he feels he's realizing something. The camera is currently in a 
            close up, just showing Jeff as before, but then cuts back to a medium shot being 
            more inclusive and showing all three again as Lisa and Stella prepare to see what 
            Jeff is seeing.</p>
            
            <p>This shot includes a deep space composition showing Lisa grab Jeff's viewfinder, 
            and once she gives it to him, he loads the viewfinder with a picture of the flowers 
            and alternates between looking at the picture and the actual flowers.</p>
            
            <p>He hands Lisa the viewfinder so she can see the difference, and she does the same 
            thing. She looks through it, and Hitchcock uses the Kuleshov effect when he juxtaposes 
            this pov image with a similar shot of the flowers from earlier, to give us context 
            for the picture of the flowers and the real thing as Lisa switches between the viewfinder 
            and reality.</p>
            
            <p>Also Jeff is telling her to look at the picture and switch back to the real flowers, 
            while she does it. The combination of her switching and him telling her to, along with 
            Lisa doing so and the camera showing this through Lisa's pov almost provides an indirect 
            narration from Jeff, as if we are Lisa (since she is who we are identifying with here)
            and Jeff is walking us through the process.</p>
            
            <p>He does the same thing with Stella, then promptly points out that something must be 
            under the flowers since they've clearly been removed and put back. Lisa suspects that 
            it's Lars' wife's body. Stella quickly shuts this down stating that there's no way her 
            body would fit there, and says she thinks the body is cut and scattered around town. 
            Jeff jumps in and confidently restates that something is under the flowers. He and Lisa 
            then conclude it may be the tools Lars used to kill and dispose of his wife with.</p>
            
            <p>This conversation about tools takes place on a different vertical third of the frame 
            that Stella is on, which allows her to be more or less isolated in the frame, keeping 
            her separate from the conversation and conveying her looking outside, possibly noticing 
            something striking, which she does, and alerts Jeff about it, making it a closed frame 
            observation. It also confirms we are currently identifying with Jeff since he isn't 
            looking and neither are we. When Jeff looks, another pov cut shows Lars packing a suitcase, 
            and Jeff is immediately onto something, commanding the two to get him a pencil and paper to 
            write on.</p>
            
            <p>As they're frantically gathering around a table with the pencil and paper, a zoom in 
            brings us closer to them, a shottype that tells us something is going on and a major 
            shift in the situation is about to happen.</p>
            
            <p>We then see a high angle shot looking down at them and the table from the ceiling as Jeff begins writing. He starts
            with Lars' name on an envelope, then writes, asking Lars what he did with his wife, on the paper. As he writes the
            question, the camera, once again, zooms in on the paper, continuing the significance of this moment bringing more
            specified attention to the question, as well as giving us the ability to see what he's writing. The slow revelation of
            the question may also be symbolic of how the story of the murder is slowly getting revealed.</p>
            
            <p>Jeff places the note in the envelope and the screen fades to black.</p>
            
            <p>This scene not only gives a new side to Jeff's investigation, it even keeps the search for the truth alive. He stated
            right before this scene that he was just starting to be convinced by Doyle that he was wrong about his suspicion.
            However, he now has new confidence and leads into the murder, and the search keeps going.</p>

            <h2>Response to the Hitchcock/Truffaut Discussion on this Film:</h2>
            
           <p>Hitchcock used James in a very creative way in that he portrayed him as a total Peeping Tom, which he said raised
            complaints, specifically by Critic of the London Observer. However, this didn't change Hitchcock's mind, if anything, it
            reinforced the fact that, even if it's wrong on the screen, it's representative of everybody in the same situation. He
            states himself that most people who see a woman undressing or a man puttering around his room, would stare instead of
            saying “it's none of my business”. People will complain about this, but we all do it. He also mentions the Kuleshov
            effect with the specific shot of Stewart looking at the dog, and how if there was a “...half naked girl exercising in
            front of her open window, and you go back to a smiling Stewart again, this time he's a dirty old man” (H/T, 216). The
            Kuleshov effect takes place throughout the film, mainly, since there are so many instances of pov shots and matching
            these with a following expression imply the expression holds the emotion the character feels after seeing what they saw
            in the point of view.</p>
