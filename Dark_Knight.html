        <h2>The Production Being Discussed</h2>
        <p>The film being written about in this analysis is The Dark Knight (2008), a cinematic 
            and technical marvel revolving around the forces of good and evil in the form of a
            superhero and villain. The film was directed by Christopher Nolan, a mastermind in the
            Film industry, who has multiple other extremely successful films to his name, including
            Inception (2010), Interstellar (2014), and Dunkirk (2017).
        </p>

        <p>The story is about the very iconic superhero and supervillain dynamic of Batman, played by
            Christain Bale, and The Joker, played by Heath Ledger. Batman faces the very intelligent,
            dark-minded and unpredictable Joker. This time, Batman is joined in the by the newly elected
            District Attorney, Harvey Dent, who was elected “on a promise of bringing an end to the city's
            crime wave” (Fandom). However, after a series of heinous crimes, including murder, arson, theft,
            and destruction of the city, The Joker leaves Batman and Dent questioning how they will stop
            him, and if it's even possible, This battle becomes even harder for good to win after The Joker
            murders Dent's love interest and leaves him burned and scarred, which causes Dent to also become
            evil, which he originally set out to destroy.

<div class="content" id="common_themes">
    <h2>Common Themes</h2>

    <p>The most obvious theme I noticed in this film is the battle of good and evil. Batman's entire identity
        stems from his desire to avenge the murder of his parents by fighting crime in his city and preying on
        those who prey on the innocent, which, in this case, is The Joker. Batman represents good, or at least a
        variant of good. On the other hand, The Joker wants nothing more than to kill, steal, and destroy
        everything that Batman stands for. Both sides can be seen in the character of Harvey Dent, as he
        essentially ends up fighting both sides due to his heroic origins and villainous character arc.</p>

    <p>Another big theme in this film is the corruptibility of man, with the best example being the character
        arch of Harvey Dent. He is introduced and built up as a purely intentioned hero with a clean reputation
        who uses the justice system instead of violence to fight crime. David Chen says "Dent represents absolute
        good, a goodness that is so pure, that has so much potential to change Gotham, that even Batman considers
        hanging up his spurs" (SlashFilm). However, with the murder of his fiance, Rachel, and brutal burning
        that The Joker inflicts on him, Harvey is turned to evil as he seeks revenge for Rachel, which involves him
        committing murders of his own, and basically undoes everything he's done to fight crime in Gotham. Another
        smaller example could be when the civilians and prisoners are put on the ferries, and the Joker threatens to
        blow both boats up, if one doesn't pull the trigger on the other first. Once this threat is made, the civilians,
        who are normally moral, begin supporting blowing up the prisoners. Although an argument can be made to justify
        either decision, it goes to show that people will change or abandon their morals based on their
        circumstances
    </p>

    <div class="content" id="mise_en_scene">
    <h2>Mise-en-Scene</h2>
    
    <p>Something I found particularly interesting about the mise-en-scene was the rugged 
and dirty look of the Jokers makeup The makeup and hair isn't neat, but patchy, 
lacking the clean, sharp look previous Jokers had. His clothes, althoug still colorful 
and formal, are still dull in color, unsaturated, and not exactly neat. This look 
serves the purpose of making him darker and more intimidating, along with making him 
more natural. Seung Ho talks about this as well, an compares him to Jack Nicolson's 
Joker saying “The makeup and hair is done so that it looks natural. Jack's Joke seem[ed] 
artificial with perfect makeup and hair” (Weebly). This appearance is very effective for 
The Joker's character since the natural aspect of his makeup and costume bring him 
closer to us as humans, which combines with his actions and dark persona to give viewers 
the feeling that this character could actually exist. As mentioned, most, if not all
Joker were lacking this effect</p>

<p>Another aspect of costuming I thought worked well was making more of Batman's suit black, 
as opposed to the large amount of yellow he would traditionally have. This was effective 
to the film because, similar to The Joker's look that was just mentioned, it made the 
appearance fresh, and didn't have the same exact look that Batman traditionally had. On top 
of the much darker color pallet, his suite looked much more technologically advanced, which 
conveyed a more tactical and futuristic version of the character. Maybe some wouldn't be 
attracted to this look, but I thought it did a great job of making him seem more powerful and 
capable of everything he did with the suit that was maybe less realistic, while still
maintaining verisimilitude. Because of that aspect, it was a lot easier to take him seriously
</p>

<div class="content" id="prop_costume_crit">
<h2>Small Criticism of Props and Costume</h2>

<p>Overall, the costuming was very well done, in my opinion, since the film 
    experimented with unconventional elements to make for a fresh and more 
    powerful feel. However, one improvement to mise-en-scene I think the 
    filmmakers could've made is making Batman just a bit more verisimilar. 
    As previously mentioned, they bridged the gap between the realism is 
    Batman's suit and the realism in his abilities, however I think they 
    could do a bit more to explain the science and mechanics behind his suit 
    and utilities. 
    
    <p>For example, in the first half of the film, Lucious shows 
    Bruce a new piece he developed for the suit that is weaponized, improves 
    Bruce's mobility, allowing for more agile movement, and provide better 
    protection against certain threats. Lucious does give a very brief explanation 
    for the design and benefits of the new piece, but it still doesn't make a lot 
    of sense as to how it could be developed the way he explains it. </p>
    
    <p>It's understandable, since the focus of the piece is more about the fact that it 
    works and benefits Batman, as opposed to how it works. One might even argue that 
    “it's just a movie, it's not supposed to be realistic”, and that's true. However
    it's still frustrating to be in the dark about how these elements of the film work, 
    and arguably, almost makes the viewer feel a bit separated from the characters. 
    This is especially true for a character like Batman who is known as the
    superhero without any special, unrealistic powers, and just uses wealth and intelligence
    </p>

<h2>Effects</h2>

<p>A very impressive element of this film is the use of practical effects when CGI would 
    be not just beneficial, but justified. Zachary Kandell from Screen Rant states, “Director 
    Christopher Nolan uses practical effects where possible rather than CGI in his movies, 
    and this runs across The Dark Knight Trilogy” (ScreenRant). When successful, this approach 
    conveys dedication to giving the audience authenticity, which I find admirable. Two big 
    examples of practical effects were the truck flip and the hospital explosion The truck flip 
    was done with an explosive piston that, when triggered by the stunt driver, sent the truck 
    up enough to flip completely about the cabin, landing upside down. There were many infrastructural 
    issues to worry about, such as “If [the truck] gets halfway up and falls to the side… it wouldve 
    gone through a [buildings] window” (ScreenRant). They also had to worry about the infrastructure 
    of the street itself, including that “...there were only a couple places on the street they could 
    fire the piston without causing serious damage to something underground, making it so the driver 
    could only trigger [the piston] at one of a couple of specific locations.” (ScreenRant). There were 
    other safety issues, according to Kandell, however, the stunt turned out not only successful, but 
    very memorable</p>

<p>The hospital explosion was also done very practically. As Cooper Hood, from ScreenRant states, 
    according to Christopher Nolan, special effects supervisor Chris Corbould had an idea: Heath 
    would walk through the hospital with smaller explosions going off, then after they stopped, 
    there would be a beat where nothing happened, and Heath would act like the explosions were 
    malfunctioning. In reality, this beat was intentional and made sure Heath could escape the hospital
    before the larger explosions occurred, bringing the building down completely. Of course, this 
    meant “that [Nolan] had one shot at getting it right”, and so, a lot of planning took place, as 
    Hood also says, “Not only was the scene executed exactly as Nolan and his team wanted, but it also 
    came after extensive practice” (ScreenRant). In the end, theycexecuted the scene authentically, 
    which made it a very impressive example of successful practical effects</p>

<div id="cinematography">
<h2>Cinematography</h2>

<p>In general, the cinematography was very well done. Nolan uses a combination of many, 
    long, dramatic, and slowly paces establishing shots that lead into quick, dynamic 
    closer shots right after. This gives the audience time to develop a sense of space 
    and situation, right before diving right into the heat of the action within that 
    scene which then keeps the audience entertained. This is possibly the most noticeable 
    in the first scene where The Joker and his men rob the bank. There is a great variety 
    in shot types, dynamic and static shots, and shades of lighting, among other elements
    used throughout the film to make for a very dramatic but entertaining experience</p>

<h2>Criticism of Cinematography and Editing</h2>

<p>
Although the cinematography is stellar overall, there are moments I've noticed where 
certain shots are filmed and edited so that it's tough to understand what's going on, 
and even almost seemingly lacking continuity. An example that comes to mind is the scene 
where Batman infiltrates Lau's office to capture him and question him for involvement in 
the mob's crimes. The scene begins with a textbook establishing shot, encompassing the 
tower Batman is standing on as he watches over Lau's office. However, a series of close ups 
show Batman placing explosives on the office windows and breaching the building as they go off. 
Although viewers can piece together that this is what's happening, it's very confusing to 
figure out from just watching the shots because the way they are captured and edited, they 
don't capture the scene very well</p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="Acting">
    <h2>Acting</h2>
<p>
Arguably the most impressive aspect of this entire film is the performance that Heath 
Ledger gives in playing The Joker I firmly believe that one can't write a well rounded 
critical analysis of this film without mentioning Ledger' absolutely embodied performance 
as his psychopathic character. It may just be the greatest case of method acting in modern 
cinematic history. Jake Massey from Lad Bible says “[Ledger] locked himself away for 
weeks, keeping a diary”, the location he was locked in being a hotel. He later states “The 
diary contained a wide array of manic musing, depicting hyenas, clowns, comic strips…”(LadBible). 
He was also method acting on the physical end as well, “...encouraging co-sta Christain 
Bale [Batman] to actually hit him during an interrogation scene”. Bale mentions “'He was 
slamming himsel around, and there were tiled walls inside of that set which were cracked and 
dented from him hurling himself into them' (LadBible). Heath's commitment to the role was covered 
in every aspect of his performance. He dove into his character physically, mentally, psychologically 
and emotionally using the method technique to the fullest extent, which was on of, if not the 
most impressive elements of the film
